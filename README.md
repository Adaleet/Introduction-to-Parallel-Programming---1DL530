# Parallel Programming

This course provides an introduction to the principles of parallel programming, covering topics like concurrency, non-determinism, synchronization, and performance measurement on multicore architectures. Students are required to implement and analyze various parallel programming concepts using C++11 (or newer), focusing on shared-memory concurrency, race conditions, and classic synchronization problems like the Dining Philosophers problem.

## Assignment 1 
This assignment consists of several exercises that will introduce you to key concepts of parallel programming, such as thread concurrency, non-determinism, and race conditions. You will also perform performance measurements and work with the well-known Dining Philosophers problem.


## Assignment 2 
This assignment focuses on more advanced parallel programming concepts, including numerical integration, the Sieve of Eratosthenes, mutual exclusion algorithms, and concurrent data structures. You will explore various parallelization techniques, synchronization mechanisms, and performance evaluation across multiple cores and threads.
